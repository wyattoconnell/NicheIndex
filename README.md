# The Niche Index: A Spotify Web App
Uses the spotify API to display the obscurity of a user's top songs, artists, and saved tracks, and calculates an overall "Niche Score" that reflects the obscurity of the user's entire music library.

If running locally:

$ npm install
$ npm start

*** New changes to Spotify's developer platform stipulates that third-party apps are placed into "development mode" (details [here](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2021-05-27-improving-the-developer-and-user-experience-for-third-party-apps)). This means that only 25 preauthorized users can access the app, so if you have stumbled across this repo, you unfortunately will not be able to try it for yourself. However, please feel free to ask me any questions!
